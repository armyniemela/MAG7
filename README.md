# myproject01: Mag 7

This is my first Lede project making a webpage. Myproject01 is a bout the biggest shareholders of the Magnificient 7 companys. I chose the topic because it is something I could create visualizations for at work, and also because I know the data provides an opportunity to practice data handling, or 'doing pandas.' The topic itself, the Mag 7 companies, is constantly relevant in the investment world, so it is also interesting to me.

My datacollection for Mag7

I collected the data together with my Finnish colleague trough a financial data provider Factset. We use this regurlaly at work but I do not have access to Factset data service myself, and its licenses require employer approval. The information is pulled out as a excel file containging the information requested. Data was retrieved for each company separately by specifying how many shareholders were wanted on the list - in this case 20 - arranging them from largest to smallest. The database could not retrieve historical ownership data, only the most recently updated. Each companyâ€™s Excel file contained rows of information that was unnecessary for me, such as the source of the reported information. I edited the data somewhat immediately after retrieval, even though I knew I wanted to do further filtering in Jupyter Notebooks using Pandas.

I started with the file tablecleaning in Jupyter Notebooks, but after quickly checking the number of rows and the heads of the tables, I noticed errors in the data I had collected: the number of rows did not match the expectation of having a list of 20 owners for seven companies. After checking, I began working in a new notebook, newtablecleaning. In it, I corrected the heads of the tables and removed unnecessary columns. At this stage, I wanted to separate from the 20 largest owners of the Mag 7 companies those who are common to all. My assumption was that there would be several common owners. Additionally, I wanted to separate "natural persons" from institutional owners, i.e., fund owners managed by asset managers. 

My assumption was that there would be very few individual owners among the largest owners.

Since I had modified my data quite a bit in the notebook, I decided to start again with the original data. I wanted to practice creating a bar chart based on the ownership percentage for the top 10 owners of each Mag7 company. Finally, I downloaded all the dataframes I processed in the notebooks into Excel files. The idea is that I will eventually create visual presentations from them in Datawrapper and/or Illustrator. I had to do this two times since I had forgot MSFT and used wrong numbers in 4-6 dataframes!

My visual work for Mag 7

I used datawrapper and Illustrator and I already can use them well. I wish I had more time to do an oppening picture for my story but I'll do something nice in the next project.

My HTML work for Mag 7

This part of the work was new for me so I used Soma's template and did some small tweeks.
